            Scott was born in 1947. He received his PhD in mathematics in 1974, working under the supervision of
            Professor Ron Mullin in the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization (C&O) at the University of
            Waterloo. He was then a professor of mathematics at St. Jerome's University and Waterloo's C&O department,
            until his retirement in 2009. He was appointed distinguished professor emeritus of mathematics at the
            University of Waterloo in 2009.

            Scott's early work was in combinatorial design theory. In the 1980's he started working in cryptography. One
            of his first contributions, with Blake, Fuji-Hara and Mullin, was an improved algorithm for computing
            discrete logarithms in characteristic-two finite fields. This work inspired Coppersmith to devise his famous
            L[1/3] algorithm in 1984. He also designed, with Agnew and Mullin, hardware architectures for implementing
            arithmetic in characteristic-two fields.

            Scott became enthralled with elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) after hearing Victor Miller's talk at Crypto
            '85. In the subsequent years, he devoted much of his research to the security analysis and efficient
            implementation of ECC. Among his contributions was the Weil pairing attack (with Menezes and Okamoto) to
            efficiently transport some instances of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem to instances of the
            ordinary discrete logarithm problem in extensions of the underlying finite field. With Gallant and Lambert,
            he showed how efficiently-computable endomorphisms could be used to accelerate Pollard's rho attack on the
            elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem.
